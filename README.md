# Wordle Attack

## Overview
**Wordle Attack** is an engaging word-guessing game built with React. This project expands upon the classic Wordle experience by introducing a timer and a scoring system, making it more competitive and fast-paced. Using the history of Wordle puzzles, players can challenge themselves to solve as many puzzles as possible within a time limit.

This project showcases my skills in React development, state management, and creating dynamic, user-centric applications.
